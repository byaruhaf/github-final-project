# Simple Interest Calculator

A simple calculator that computes the **Simple Interest (SI)** based on the provided principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Input Parameters
1. **`p`**: Principal amount  
2. **`t`**: Time period in years  
3. **`r`**: Annual rate of interest  

## Output
- **Simple Interest (SI)**:  
  \[
  \text{SI} = p \times t \times r
  \]

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-interest-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd simple-interest-calculator
   ```
3. Run the calculator script in your preferred programming environment (e.g., Python, Java, etc.).

## Example
Given the following inputs:
- `p = 1000`  
- `t = 2` years  
- `r = 5%` (0.05 in decimal form)

The **Simple Interest** is calculated as:
\[
\text{SI} = 1000 \times 2 \times 0.05 = 100
\]
